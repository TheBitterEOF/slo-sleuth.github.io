# Welcome to Data Discoveries

The intent of this page is document data structures and extraction techniques discovered during forensic analysis in my primary career.  I will focus on adding information not readily available in the wild, and I will link to code projects for related analysis tools I have created.

Validate any information here you plan to utilize: I don't assume any liability for being incorrect.  Unless otherwise stated, Consider information shared here as **publicly shared personal notes** rather than published *white papers*.  I share freely because others have shared with me, and I invite correction and discussion.

*Check back frequently as I plan to update often...*
